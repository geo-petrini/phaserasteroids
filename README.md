# phaserasteroids
Phaser3 Asteroids implementation


TODO

Better ship-asteroid collision
- add a shield hit animation
- remove shield amount by asteroid size or velocity
- when shield depleted destroy ship
- split asteroid  
- shake camera (DONE)

Better asteoid generation
- ISSUE currently 800 asteroids are created (this.WORLD_WIDTH*0.1), it takes some time to generate them
- create asteroids based on ship vicinity

Radar
- implement a minimap/radar that shows the asteroids location
